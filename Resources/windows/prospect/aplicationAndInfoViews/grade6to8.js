In addition, the Smartboard allows children to learn developmentally appropriate concepts in an innovative way.  Kindergarten students also have access to a shared iPad cart.\n\nBialik Kindergarten children are happily engaged in all aspects of their learning. Bialik students are proud of their learning and demonstrate it daily!Bialikâ€™s Senior Division is a special place where academic excellence, respect for the individual, a strong sense of community, active participation and Mentchlikheit are the cornerstones of our culture. Embedded throughout our programming is a living connection to Israel exemplified through varied activities and enhanced by Young Emissaries who provide interactive activities designed to bring the heart and spirit of Israel to our students. \n\nBialik sets high academic standards that prepare students to succeed at TanenbaumCHAT and other high schools. Students study a full general studies and Jewish studies curriculum on a rotary timetable, with specialists in the different subjects areas (science, math, art, Jewish history, Hebrew, etc.). \n\nStudents participate in a rich array of co-curricular programming. All students belong to one of four Houses named after Universities in Israel. Through friendly inter-house competition, students from all three grade levels participate in monthly gatherings and have varied opportunities to become involved and cultivate leadership skills. Our Mechanech program provides students with a teacher advocate and a values-based curriculum covering topics that relate to Jewish ethics and current issues. \n\nAll three grades enjoy out-of-town trips designed to build a cohesive cohort while extending learning beyond the classroom. \n\nOutstanding extra-curricular programs are an important component of Senior Division life. We currently have a full range of extra-curricular sports teams. Dance group and Choir are two other avenues for involvement in school life and both these groups are invited to perform at various community events.\n\nIn Senior Division, the rich and varied curriculum and broad range of opportunities, allows students to form strong friendships and develop learning and leadership skills which provide them with an excellent foundation for life beyond elementary school',
